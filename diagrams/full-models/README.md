This directory contains the "full" visual documentation of the OHSU Entities Ontology.  "Full" means everything that the current implementation of 
the model allows us to say, but not necessarily all the things we will say in our production data.  These files exist for documentation purposes and 
should not be used as a guide for using the model to mark up production data.
